- 👋 Hi, I’m @snailtail
- 👀 I try to solve problems using technology, without creating even more problems. Which can be problematic at times, but oh so much fun!
- 🌱 I usually use .NET / C# but I play around with PowerShell and Python as well.
- I have roughly 3 decades of experience from working in IT, with various perspectives and roles over the years. My main area of interest has always been development and programming, ever since I got my first computer, a Commodore 64, in the 80's.
- :christmas_tree: When december comes 'round I try to solve as many of the [Advent of Code puzzles](https://adventofcode.com) as I can.
- Disclaimer: Most stuff on here is just for fun, testing, and/or learning. So I probably haven't implemented rigorous error handling, unit testing and so on - as one would in production grade code. If you intend to use any of my code from here make sure you figure out what it does before you run it anywhere.
