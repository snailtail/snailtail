# 💫 About Me:
👋 Hi, I’m @snailtail<br>👀 I try to solve problems using technology, without creating even more problems. Which can be problematic at times, but oh so much fun!<br>🌱 I usually use .NET / C# but I play around with PowerShell and Python as well.<br>⏳ I have roughly 3 decades of experience from working in IT, with various perspectives and roles over the years. My main area of interest has always been development and programming, ever since I got my first computer, a Commodore 64, in the 80's.<br>🎄 When december comes 'round I try to solve as many of the Advent of Code puzzles as I can.
