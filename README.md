- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @snailtail
- ðŸ‘€ I try to solve problems using technology, without creating even more problems. Which can be quite problematic.
- ðŸŒ± I usually use .NET / C# but I play around with PowerShell and Python as well.
- :christmas_tree: When december comes 'round I try to solve as many of the [Advent of Code puzzles](https://adventofcode.com) as I can.
- :laughing: Comics are also fun! [xkcd](https://xkcd.com) is always a classic, and [Comic AgilÃ©](https://www.comicagile.net) will have you laughing your way to a better understanding of agile ways.
- Disclaimer: Most stuff on here are just for fun, testing, and/or learning. So I probably haven't implemented rigorous error handling, unit testing and so on - as one would in production grade code. If you intend to use any of my code from here make sure you figure out what it does before you run it anywhere.
